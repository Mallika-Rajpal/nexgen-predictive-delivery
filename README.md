# NexGen Predictive Delivery Command Center

A data-driven logistics intelligence platform that enables **predictive, proactive decision-making** for delivery operations.

Built as part of the **Logistics Innovation Challenge**, this project transforms NexGen Logistics from reactive issue handling to a **predictive operations model** using analytics, explainable risk scoring, and machine learning.

---

## Problem Statement

NexGen Logistics operates across multiple warehouses, carriers, and delivery priorities. Despite steady growth, the company faces:

- Delivery delays detected only after failures occur  
- Rising operational and penalty costs  
- Inconsistent customer experience  
- Limited use of existing data for decision-making  

Traditional dashboards answer *“what went wrong?”* but fail to answer:

> **“Which orders are likely to fail next — and what should we do now?”**

---

##  Solution Overview

The **Predictive Delivery Command Center** is an interactive Streamlit application that:

- Predicts delivery delays **before they happen**
- Identifies **high-risk orders** and **unreliable carriers**
- Quantifies **₹ cost leakage**
- Enables **data-backed operational interventions**

The platform combines **rule-based intelligence** (for transparency) with **machine learning** (for predictive accuracy).

##  Key Features

###  Executive Dashboard
- Total orders, delayed orders, delay rate  
- Average customer rating  
- Real-time operational visibility  

###  Explainable Delay Risk Scoring
- Priority impact  
- Carrier reliability  
- Delivery duration  
- Produces a **0–100 delay risk score**

###  Machine Learning Prediction
- Random Forest model predicts delay probability  
- ML complements rule-based scoring  
- Cached for performance and stability  

###  At-Risk Order Identification
- Rule-based high-risk orders  
- ML-based high-risk orders  
- Adjustable thresholds for operations teams  

###  Cost Impact Calculator
- Estimates avoidable cost from proactive intervention  
- Adjustable assumptions (success rate, avoidable cost %)  
- Converts predictions into **₹ business value**

###  Interactive Visualizations
- Delay rate by delivery priority  
- Carrier performance comparison  
- Delay vs customer rating impact  
- Cost leakage concentration

##  Datasets Used

The application integrates multiple real-world logistics datasets:

- **orders.csv** – Order details, priority, value, origin, destination  
- **delivery_performance.csv** – Promised vs actual delivery, ratings, costs  
- **routes_distance.csv** – Distance, traffic delays, route factors  
- **vehicle_fleet.csv** – Fleet characteristics  
- **warehouse_inventory.csv** – Inventory distribution  
- **customer_feedback.csv** – Ratings and feedback  
- **cost_breakdown.csv** – Detailed cost components  

> Not all orders have complete data, reflecting real operational conditions.
